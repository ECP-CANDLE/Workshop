Hi All,

We are looking forward to the hands on tutorials scheduled for tomorrow. Please remember to bring your laptop, and to install Anaconda before you arrive (if you havenâ€™t already). If you are having problems, some of us will be there as early as 8:00am, and we can help. The workshop will start at 9:00am. Specific instructions for the different platforms are listed below. 


A. Mac (preferred)

B. Linux (supported)

C. Windows (unfortunately we will have limited support for windows users, if you can use a mac or linux laptop that would be best)

Best,
Tom
