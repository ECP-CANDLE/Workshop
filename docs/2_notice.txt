Hi All,

We are looking forward to the hands on tutorials scheduled for tomorrow. Please remember to bring your laptop, and to install Anaconda before you arrive (if you havenâ€™t already). If you are having problems, some of us will be there as early as 8:00am, and we can help. The workshop will start at 9:00am. Specific instructions for the different platforms are listed below. 

The example codes are available for download at https://github.com/ECP-Candle/workshop. The example codes are located in the Topics directory in the relevant subdirectories. You should test your Anaconda environment using the linear_regression.py script located in the 1_first_example subdirectory of the Topics directory.

The example codes might change slightly before tomorrow, but the linear regression example in the first example folder is a good test for your environment.



A. Mac (preferred)

B. Linux (supported)

C. Windows (unfortunately we will have limited support for windows users, if you can use a mac or linux laptop that would be best)

Best,
Tom
